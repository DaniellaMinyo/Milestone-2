Code Institute - Milestone project 2 - Interactive Frontend development

This project is a star trek themed memory game built using html, css and javascript.

You can visit the deployed site [here](https://daniellaminyo.github.io/Milestone-2/).

## 1. UX

### 1.1. Project Goals

The aim of the project is to create a simple and fun interactive memory game.
Like most memory games, the user can click on two cards that will flip. If the images on the cards match the cards will stay revealed, else they flip back. When all the cards are matched the game is complete.

### 1.2. User stories

- As a user of the site, I'd like to easily use the game.
- As a user I want the game to include fun and interactive features.
- As a user I want the game to be well presented and visually appealing.
- As a user I want to know how long it took me to complete the game.
- As a user I want to easily play the game again.

### 1.3. Wireframes

The wireframes were made using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/).
